An AI to play the game Minesweeper.

This is a python program that creates a  AI to play the game of Minesweeper. It contains two files: runner.py, which is a pre-written code for the GUI, and minesweeper.py, which contains methods and classes that I have implemented to run the AI.

This project has been assigned by Harvard's CS50 course on Artificial Intelligence.
